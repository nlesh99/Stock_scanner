# AN2-CAT-Reporting-1

## Introduction

This repository contains a comprehensive Python project focused on data analysis and forecasting. The project is structured around two key Jupyter notebooks: "CAT_Code_Forecast.ipynb" and "CAT_Code_Actual.ipynb". The primary goal is to process, clean, and analyze data, culminating in a forecasting model that provides valuable insights for business or financial planning.

## Getting Started

### Loading the Files

The project consists of two main Jupyter notebooks:

1. `CAT_Code_Forecast.ipynb`: This notebook focuses on data aggregation and forecasting analysis in the "Forecast Spend and Weight" dataset.
2. `CAT_Code_Actual.ipynb`: This notebook is dedicated to data cleaning, particularly handling null values in the "Actual Spend and Weight" dataset.

## Steps for the Project

### CAT_Code_Forecast.ipynb

1. **Importing Libraries**: Import necessary Python libraries for data manipulation and visualization.
2. **Loading Data**: 
   - Read the dataset into a Pandas dataframe for analysis.
   - **Checking for Nulls**: The data is checked for null values to assess the need for cleaning and preprocessing. This step is crucial to ensure the quality and reliability of the analysis.
   - **Replacement of Nulls**: In case of null values, appropriate methods are employed for their replacement. This may involve using statistical measures such as mean or median of the data, or more complex imputation methods, depending on the nature of the data and the missing values.
3. **Data Aggregation**: Group and aggregate data based on various attributes like 'FAC', 'REGION', and 'FCST_TYP'.
4. **Forecast Analysis**: Analyze the aggregated data to derive forecasting insights.

### CAT_Code_Actual.ipynb

1. **Data Cleaning**: Focus on cleaning the "Actual Spend and Weight" dataset.
   - **Initial Assessment**: Evaluate the dataset for data quality issues, with a particular focus on missing or inconsistent data.
2. **Handling Nulls**: 
   - Identify columns with significant null values, specifically 'FCST_TYP_1_WEIGHT' & 'FCST_TYP_2_WEIGHT'.
   - Apply summary statistics to address these null values effectively.
3. **Grouping Data for Imputation**: 
   - Group the data by 'FAC' and 'REGION'.
   - Replace nulls with the mean of each group, ensuring a more tailored and accurate approach to data imputation.
4. **Dealing with Remaining Nulls**: 
   - For null values in groups lacking sufficient data, use the overall mean of the respective columns.
   - This step ensures a comprehensive approach to null value treatment.
5. **Data Validation**: 
   - Post-cleaning, verify the integrity of the dataset.
   - Ensure there are no missing values remaining in critical columns.
6. **Finalizing Data**: 
   - Confirm that the dataset is now clean, consistent, and ready for further analysis or integration with other datasets.


## Conclusion

This project exemplifies a thorough approach to data analysis and forecasting using Python. Through meticulous data cleaning and aggregation processes, it provides a robust foundation for generating accurate forecasts, essential for strategic decision-making in various domains.
